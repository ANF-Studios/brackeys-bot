# BrackeysBot [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/YilianSource/brackeys-bot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/YilianSource/brackeys-bot) [![Discord Server](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/243005537342586880/widget.png)](https://discord.gg/brackeys)

The official Brackeys Discord bot!

## Running

Upon building and running, the bot will create a `config.yaml` file next to your executeable. This is where all of the bot configuration will be placed. The only fields that are essential for running the bot are `token` and `prefix`.

```yaml
token: 'Get this from the developer dashboard!'
prefix: '[]'
```
